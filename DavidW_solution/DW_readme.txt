TCSS-504 Warmup/Readiness Assignment

Time to finish: 8 hours

Problems encountered:
While iterating over the list of lists to check neighbors cells for bombs, corner cells and edge cells only have 3 and 5 neighbors, respectively. Restricting the neighbor-checking process accordingly in an economic manner was challenging, but accomplished with help.

Shortcomings: This code's time complexity is n^2.
