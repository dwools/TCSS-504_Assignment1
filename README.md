Team Members: David Woolston, Jackson Davis, Sanya Sinha

David Woolston: 
- Time spent: Approximately 8 hours 
- Shortcomings: MineGenerator accepts 4 parameters: "Bomb Odds", "Rows", "Columns", and "# of minefields", but the parameters are passed in that particular order
  when the class is called: MineGenerator(5, 3, 3, 4). Any left blank are randomized. However due to how to parameters are called, one cannot for example, leave "Bomb Odds" blank
  but specify the rest. Essentially, parameters cannot be independently specified or randomized.
